ISA:

Address Bus     : 16 bits
Data Bus        : 16 bits
Register Address: 4 bits
Register Memory : 16 bits

code.txt    => contains the assembly code
source.txt  => is the symbol table generated by the first pass ( paas1.c)
binary.txt  => is the opcode table
mac.txt     => contains the machine code generated after second paas (paas2.c)
NOTE: So first compile and run paas1.c before paas2.c .
      Machine code generated after you compile and run paas2.c.
